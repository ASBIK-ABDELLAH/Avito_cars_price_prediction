# Avito_cars_price_prediction

### Introduction
After scraping an e-commerce website in my last project, https://github.com/ASBIK-ABDELLAH/Avito_scraping, i've decided to make this data useful by cleaning it and by trying to build a machine learning model which predict the price of cars.

This project will contain my pre-processing of data and machine learning models.

### The Dataset

'car_city' : The name of city where is the car sold.\
'car_cv_man_auto': Horsepower of the car and being automatic or manual.\
'car_equipements': Car equipements.\
'car_information ': Some information about the car.\
'car_name': The car name.\
